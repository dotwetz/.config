# Scripts for Script Development

These scripts are generally to make development of scripts easier. They can be copied into an existing script or incorporated into a Script Library for consistent use, which is what I did with a lot these in my [script library][001005b5].

## Contents

### Text Utilities

- [Extract Between][f3fd3ca9]
- [Search With Regex][4b6da3a9]
- [Split Text][561dd09a]
- [Transform Text][5748a92f]

### File Utilities

- [Get File Metadata][jdksl139]
  - Example of using shell to get metadata of files. I use this to see if a file was downloaded from certain sites or was written by some certain author, if it is then I move it to some location (much like Hazel).

### Various

- [Click at Mouse Location][jau3ndi8]
